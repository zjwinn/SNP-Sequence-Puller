# SNP-Sequence-Puller
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide base-pair exchanges that occur genome wide in all living organisms. These SNPs can be used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecular markers. This program takes a reference genome, an alternate allele at a SNP site, and a specified flanking sequence length. The program then takes those inputs and outputs a sequence which is of some length with a centeralized SNP in the middle of the strand (I.E., ATTAG[C\T]GTACG). This output can then be taken and used in downstream process of molecular marker design.
